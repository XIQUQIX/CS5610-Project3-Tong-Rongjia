## Project Objective

Build a web application designed for Northeastern University students to create and join spontaneous campus-related events—such as "Run to Costco," "Study in Snell at 7 PM," "Looking for 3 players for badminton," or "Chess night tonight." This platform helps students make new friends, reduce campus isolation, find study partners, and engage in spontaneous social life outside of class.
