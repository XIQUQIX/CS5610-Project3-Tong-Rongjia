# Peer Review — CS5610 Project 3 (Huskyhub)
**Reviewer:** Nandana Pradeep  


## Summary
The Project is executed really well . Good job . Very creative idea 

---



### Design document 
- **Suggestions:** Visual wireframs and Mockups are missing . 

### ReadME file 
- **Status:** Most details are present . Well done 
- **Suggestions:** Add a simple **Quickstart** (clone → `npm install` → `.env` → `npm run build`/`npm start`) and specify **frontend vs backend commands** clearly. Include sample `.env.example`.
- Add  a short section for “How polling works” + “How Google Maps is used”.
  
### Is the app useful? 
- **Status:** Yes—solid use-case for campus community.


### ESLint, no errors 
- **Status:** `eslint.config.js` present.


### Code organization 
- **Status:** Vite/React structure with `public/` and `src/` plus design doc. Good job 


### ≥3 React components with hooks  & each in its own file 
- **Suggestions:** If you can , I would suggest putting it in different folders so its easily identifiable . 


### Deployed & working 
- **Status:** Deployed and working excellently

### ≥2 Mongo collections with CRUD 
- **Status:** CRUD is clear
- **Suggestions:** If you could mention the number of collections and the names in the ReadME , it would be better . 


### Node + Express
- **Status:** Used correctly 
- **Suggestions:** In README, list backend start command and port(s).

### Prettier 
- **Status:** Used correctly 

### Standard HTML
- **Status:** Good job 

### CSS organized by components 
- **Suggestions:** `Component.css` imported by `Component.jsx` or CSS Modules; avoid large global CSS where possible. But overall great job 


### Secrets not exposed 
- **Status:** : No secrets exposed . good job 

### Separate package.json for backend and frontend 
- **Status:** Root shows a single `package.json`.
- **Suggestions:** The rubric asks for **two package.json** files—consider `/client/package.json` and `/server/package.json` . You only have a package.json for backend and for frontend its given globally , I am assuming.
-  If you could put them in folders corresponding to frontend and backend , it would be better . 

### MIT license
- **Status:** Present. Great job 

### PropTypes for React components
- **Suggestions:** Add `prop-types` and define PropTypes for components that accept props . Proptype is missing 

**Overall Good work!**
